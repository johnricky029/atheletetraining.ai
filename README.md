🏃‍♂️ Real-Time Analysis and Enhancement of Athlete Training
Using HAR, OpennCV, CNN & YOLOv8

This project focuses on real-time analysis of athlete movements—specifically football player performance—using Human Action Recognition (HAR), Computer Vision, and Deep Learning.
The system evaluates shooting technique, player positioning, angles, and overall biomechanics using video/image data and generates actionable feedback for athletes and coaches.

🚀 Features
✅ Real-Time Object Detection
Detects players, ball, goalkeeper, and referee using YOLOv8
Works on live video or uploaded match footage

✅ Player Performance Analysis
Evaluates shooting angles, movement patterns, errors, and scoring probability
Identifies technical flaws in posture, body alignment, stride, and biomechanics

✅ Action Recognition (HAR)
Tracks athlete actions like running, shooting, jumping
Classifies actions and identifies incorrect techniques

✅ Deep Learning Integration
Uses CNN models, YOLOv8, OpenCV, and ANNs
Provides frame-wise analysis and recommendations

✅ Coach Dashboard
Complete analytical output
Helps in strategy building, player correction & man-marking optimization
